      <p data-search="Transpose and FlattenSo now we know how to multiply matrices using Mathematica s Dot function  This also works for higher rank tensors  more indices  such as  m  abc  n  cde     mn   abde    which we can implement asm   RandomComplex      10  20  30   n   RandomComplex      30  40  50   m    Dimensions    10 20 30    n    Dimensions    30 40 50    m n    Dimensions    10 20 40 50    Here we used Dimensions to see that check that  m  abc   is indeed a rank three tensor of size  10 20 30   and that Dot contracts the adjacent indices in m n  leaving the remaining indices in the same order What if the indices we want to contract aren t adjacent  The trick is to shuffle the indices of our tensors using either Transpose or Flatten TransposeLet s start with Transpose  Given a tensor  m   the two simplest uses of this function are Transpose m  and Transpose m  k lt   gt l   The first of these transposes the first two indices of  m  m   RandomComplex      10  20  30   m    Dimensions    10 20 30    Transpose m     Dimensions    20 10 30    The second form of the function allows us to specify which indices are transposed  For example  taking k 1 and l 3 will transpose the 1st and 3rd indices of  m  m   RandomComplex      10  20  30   m    Dimensions    10 20 30    Transpose m  1  lt   gt  3     Dimensions    30 20 10    Using this second form  we can contract tensors such as  m  abc  p  dec   m   RandomComplex      10  20  30   p   RandomComplex      40  50  30   m Transpose p  1  lt   gt  3     Dimensions    10 20 50 40    What if we want the indices of the resulting tensor to be ordered as  10 20 40 50  instead of  10 20 50 40   Obviously  we could do the calculation in two steps  first constructing the product as above  and then taking a further transpose on the 3rd and 4th indices  Fortunately  Transpose can do this in one step  The result of Transpose m   k1  k2  k3   is a tensor such that the 1st index of  m  becomes the k1 th index  the 2nd index of  m  becomes the k2 th index  and so on  For example  swapping the first two indices of  m  is implemented asm   RandomComplex      10  20  30   Transpose m   2  1  3      Dimensions    20 10 30    which we interpret as sending the 1st index to position 2  the 2nd index to position 1  and leaving the 3rd index unchanged We can then perform the contraction of  m  and  p  as above but with the 3rd and 4th indices swapped asm   RandomComplex      10  20  30   p   RandomComplex      40  50  30   m Transpose p   3  2  1      Dimensions    10 20 50 40    The key to remember how this form of Transpose works is that you specify where the indices end up FlattenWe can also shuffle indices with the function Flatten  This function also has other uses   such as letting us contract more than one index at a time   but we ll focus on using it to transpose for the moment The key with Flatten is that you specify where the indices came from  For example  comparem   RandomComplex      10  20  30  40   Transpose m   1  4  2  3      Dimensions    10 30 40 20    Flatten m    1    4    2    3       Dimensions    10 40 20 30    Using Transpose with the argument  1  4  2  3   we leave the 1st index unchanged  send the 2nd index to 4th position  send the 3rd index to 2nd position  and send the 4th index to 3rd position  Using Flatten with the argument   1    4    2    3    we leave the 1st index unchanged  set the 2nd index of the result to be the 4th index of the original tensor  set the 3rd index of the result to be the 2nd index of the original tensor  and finally set the 4th index of the result to be the 3rd index of the original tensor  These operations are not the same  And the difference is whether you are thinking about where to send the indices to or where the indices came from If we want the same result from both  we would usem   RandomComplex      10  20  30  40   Transpose m   1  4  2  3      Dimensions    10 30 40 20    Flatten m    1    3    4    2       Dimensions    10 40 20 30    Transpose m   1  4  2  3      Flatten m    1    3    4    2      True   Note that if you just need to transpose a tensor  Tranpose is often faster than Flatten  For example  increasing the dimensions of  m  somewhat m   RandomComplex      10  200  300  400   Transpose m   1  4  2  3      Dimensions    RepeatedTiming    0 60360695   10 300 400 200     Flatten m    1    3    4    2       Dimensions    RepeatedTiming    4 8638016   10 300 400 200     Flatten is 8 times slower than Tranpose in this case  If you have to repeat this operation many thousands of times  this could become a huge bottleneck ">
        
So now we know how to multiply matrices using Mathematica’s Dot function. This also works for higher-rank tensors (more indices) such as $m_{abc} n_{cde} = (mn)_{abde}$, which we can implement as

The take-away from this is that many clever people have worked for a very long time on optimising the Mathematica’s built-in functions, such as Dot. In particular, when Dot is called, it turns the calculation over to a set of C++ libraries for numerical linear algebra known as the Intel MKL.

The bulk of the numerical calculations that I need are basically linear algebra – matrix-matrix, vector-matrix and more exotic multiplications. All of the entries in these tensors are “machine precision”, which roughly translates to a C++ double. Mathematica can store these numbers as “packed arrays” – working with machine precision numbers rather than “exact” quantities greatly speeds up calculations (if they are written in the right way).

Calabi-Yau manifolds are special as they are Kähler manifolds which admit Ricci-flat metrics. As of the end of 2020, there are still no complete analytic expressions for such metrics on compact manifolds, other than in the somewhat trivial cases of tori. Instead, the best we can do are approximate numerical metrics. I became interested in this a couple of years ago when trying to learn some of the machine-learning techniques that are all the rage at the moment. But before I could I apply all this fancy new technology, I first needed some data to work with. And so I found myself needing to understand how to generate these numerical metrics.
