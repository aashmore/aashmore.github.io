My research focuses on computational techniques for the geometry of string compactifications and quantum field theories. I also study geometry and string theory using purely theoretical tools, such as generalised geometry.

I grew up in the seaside town of Blackpool in the UK and received my undergraduate degree from the University of Oxford in 2011. I completed a PhD in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London and then took up a Junior Research Fellowship at Merton College, University of Oxford. I then moved to the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral fellow before heading to the University of Chicago for Marie Curie Fellowship, and then to Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris. I joined Skidmore College in Fall 2024.
